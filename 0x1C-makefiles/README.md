# Project Title: 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Makefiles in the C programming language. The tasks involve creating Makefiles with specific rules, variables, and functionalities. The project aims to enhance your understanding of Make, Makefiles, rules, variables, and compilation processes.

## Project Details

### Tasks

1. **0. make -f 0-Makefile**
   - Create your first Makefile.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Name of the executable: `school`
     - Rules: `all`
     - Variables: None

2. **1. make -f 1-Makefile**
   - Create a Makefile with additional features.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Name of the executable: `school`
     - Rules: `all`
     - Variables: `CC` (compiler), `SRC` (.c files)

3. **2. make -f 2-Makefile**
   - Create a useful Makefile with object files.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Name of the executable: `school`
     - Rules: `all`
     - Variables: `CC` (compiler), `SRC` (.c files), `OBJ` (.o files), `NAME` (executable name)

4. **3. make -f 3-Makefile**
   - Develop a Makefile with additional rules (clean, oclean, fclean, re).
   - **Requirements:**
     - Name of the executable: `school`
     - Rules: `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`
     - Variables: `CC` (compiler), `SRC` (.c files), `OBJ` (.o files), `NAME` (executable name), `RM` (program to delete files)

5. **4. A complete Makefile**
   - Build a comprehensive Makefile with advanced features.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Name of the executable: `school`
     - Rules: `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `oclean`, `re`
     - Variables: `CC` (compiler), `SRC` (.c files), `OBJ` (.o files), `NAME` (executable name), `RM` (program to delete files), `CFLAGS` (compiler flags)

### Island Perimeter (5-island_perimeter.py)

- Implement a Python function `island_perimeter(grid)` that calculates the perimeter of an island based on the given rules.
- **Requirements:**
  - Use `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line.
  - No module imports allowed.
  - Document the module and function.

### Advanced Makefile (100-Makefile)

- Develop an advanced Makefile with additional constraints.
- **Requirements:**
  - Name of the executable: `school`
  - Rules: `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `oclean`, `re`
  - Variables: `CC` (compiler), `SRC` (.c files), `OBJ` (.o files), `NAME` (executable name), `RM` (program to delete files), `CFLAGS` (compiler flags)
  - Additional constraints on the use of variables and rules.
